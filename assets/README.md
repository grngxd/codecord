> [!NOTE]
> ### this project uses some assets from [@leonardssh's vscord extension](https://github.com/leonardssh/vscord) and would definitely not be possible without it, his assets follow the MIT license.

to find installed languages press ctrl+shift+p and type "change language mode"
follow this [guide written by @leonardssh](https://github.com/leonardssh/vscord/blob/main/ADDING_LANGUAGE.md) to create the language image, also add the language name registered in vscode (e.g `typescript` or `plaintext`) to the `languages` array in `src/assets.ts`.
